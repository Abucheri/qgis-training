#Geographic Information System (GIS)
> Any system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface

+ [National Geographic Education Encyclopedia](http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/)

---

#Or more simply

> In a GIS, you connect _**data**_ with _**geography**_.

+ [GISgeography.com](http://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/)

---

#Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
--

+ Create interactive queries (user-created searches)
--

+ Analyze spatial information
--

+ Edit data in maps
--

+ Present the results of all these operations

---

#Base Maps       
+ Adding base maps will give your map context
--

+ In QGIS, you need a plugin to use base maps
--

+ There are several, but we're only going to use one of them

---

#Base Map Plugin
+ From the Plugins menu, select "Manage and Install Plugins"

![img-center-60](images/basemap2.png)

---

#Base Map Plugin

+ Search for the QuickMapServices plugin and install it

![img-center-75](images/basemap3_box.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Go to the Settings Menu
![img-center-80](images/basemap4.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Get the contributed packs
![img-center-80](images/basemap5_box.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
![img-right-45](images/basemap6_trim.png)
+ Revel in all the beautiful base maps

---

#Select a base map from the list
![img-center-80](images/p1_basemap.png)

---

#Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

---

#Download a shapefile and import
1. [Click this link](data/boros/boros.zip) and download the file to your desktop
2. Unzip the file

# Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

--

#Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

![img-center-50](images/projections-faces.png)

[FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2014/01/13/map-projections-illustrated-with-a-face/)

---

#Projections

+ For the most part we will work in **WGS 84** (latitude and longitude)
--

+ In NYC, we use a more accurate projection **NY State Plane/Long Island Zone**
![img-right-60](images/projections_NYSplane.png)

######Source: https://alidade.wikispaces.com/New+York+SPCS+Zones
---

# Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs that make it easier to talk about them
--

+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**
--

+ State Plane Long Island is referred to as **EPSG:2263**

#####Source: http://blog.hackerrank.com/new-domain-tuesday-hackerrank-reveals-data-structure-database-sql-challenges/

---

#What is a database?
+ Another source of data
--

+ A program that often runs on a computer other than the one you're using (a server)
--

+ You can connect to databases through many types of software, including QGIS

---

#What is a spatial database?
--

+ A database that stores spatial features
--

+ Optimized for processing spatial data, esp location-aware queries
--

+ Both a storage and analysis tool

![img-right-55](images/save_filter2.png)

---

#Let's talk datatypes

--

![img-center-80](images/qgis_nav7.png)

--

+ In the attribute table you will usually see *text*, *numbers*, and *dates*

---

#Let's talk datatypes

![img-center-80](images/qgis_attribute_table_number.png)

--

##Numbers will be right aligned

---

#Let's talk datatypes

![img-center-80](images/qgis_attribute_table_string.png)

--

##Text will be left aligned

---

#Database datatypes

--

+ Like attribute tables, database columns have types
--

+ Numbers, text (*strings*), and dates are the main types
--

+ Spatial databases add *geometry* columns
--

+ Geometry columns let us map our data

---

#Why use a spatial database?

--

+ One authoritative copy of data
--

+ Multiple people can use and edit it at once
--

+ Generally is going to be faster than using a shapefile

---

#Drawbacks of using a spatial database

--

+ Not as simple as a CSV file or shapefile
--

+ It takes some setup to connect to a database
--

+ Need permission to connect to a database
--

+ Need to know SQL to get the most out of it

#Thematic Maps

--

+ Focuses on a specific theme or subject area
--

+ Features on the map represent the phenomenon being mapped
--

+ Spatial features used for reference

---

#General Reference Maps

--

+ Show important physical features of an area
--

+ Include natural and man-made features
--

+ Usually meant to help aid in the navigation or discovery of locations
--

+ Usually fairly simple
--

+ Can be stylized based on the intended audience (tourists vs locals)

#Now let's ask something a little more complicated

---

#Bicyclist Injuries
+ Which community board has the highest number of bicyclist injuries off of bicycle paths?

![img-right-45](images/buffer0.png)
--

#How do we answer this?
<!-- ![img-center-40](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png) -->

---

#Steps to answer
--

1. Buffer bicyclist injuries (points)
--

2. Select injuries that happened near bike lanes (intersection of buffers with bike lane) 
--

3. Invert the selection to find injuries that happened off of bike lanes
--

4. Count the number of injuries off of bike lanes by community boards
--

5. Style the result

---

#What we're going to create
![img-center-90](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png)

---

#Step 1: Buffer bicyclist injuries

![img-center-70](images/buffer1.png)

---

#Step 1: Buffer bicyclist injuries
+ Create a 15ft around injury locations

![img-center-60](images/buffer2.png)

---

#Buffering features
--

+ Gives "size" to 2-D features
--

+ Points don't have area
--

+ Lines have length but don't have width
--

+ Allows for analysis of overlap and intersection

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-left-50](images/buffer3.png)
![img-right-48](images/buffer4_box.png)

---

#Oops
![img-center-70](images/buffer5.png)

---

#SRID Map Units
--

+ Each projection has a base unit of distance
--

+ For WGS84 it's decimal degrees 
--

+ How far is 15 decimal degrees?
--

+ Have to convert projection to measure distance in projection that matches desired units of measure
--

+ Let’s use 2263 (NYS Plane Long Island Sound)
--

+ (The Map Units are in feet)

---

#Pop Quiz
![img-right-50](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7306/8731759135_58989f9e56.jpg)
+ Reproject the `injuries` layer to SRID 2263
--

+ Right click the layer and select `Save As...`
--

+ Select the new projection
--

+ Click `OK`

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-right-45](images/buffer6.png)
+ Make sure you select your reprojected layer
+ Set the distance to 15 (this time it'll be feet)
+ Set your output shapefile
+ Select `OK`

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-center-70](images/buffer7.png)

---

#Step 2: Select injuries near bike lanes
![img-center-70](images/buffer8.png)

---

#Select by location in QGIS
+ There's a plug-in for that

![img-left-55](images/spatialq1.png)
![img-right-43](images/spatialq2.png)

---

#Select by location in QGIS
![img-right-40](images/spatialq3.png)
+ Select the buffered injuries layer
+ Select `Intersects`
+ Select the bike routes layer
+ Select `Create new selection`
+ Click `Apply`

---

#Select by location in QGIS
![img-right-70](images/spatialq4_box2.png)
+ Click `Close`

---

#What did we just do?
--

1. Created a 15ft buffer around bicyclist injuries
--

2. Selected injuries that intersected a bike lane<br>
--

(Meaning it happened on or near a bike lane)
--


#Still to do
--

+ Find the injuries that happened off of bike lanes
--

+ Count injuries off bike lane by Community Board
--

+ Style the result

+ Create a layer of the selected features

---

#Step 4: Join result to Community Boards
![img-right-50](images/join_cd_injury.png)
+ Join the Community Boards to the bicyclist injuries off of bicycle lanes

---

#Step 5: Style the result
![img-center-90](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png)


---

#Your Turn
+ Filter the result for your borough
+ Style a map of just the community boards in your borough
+ Develop a hypothesis as to why the injuries are happening in those areas

---

#What we've covered
--

+ Reviewed basic mapping concepts
--

+ Reviewed projections
--

+ Added basemaps and layers (shapefile and CSV)
--

+ Styling features
--

+ Introduced spatial databases
--

+ Connected to a spatial database, filtered, and saved data as a shapefile

+ Which pages refer to properties in Brooklyn that have been built on since 1950?
--

+ What are the addresses of those properties?

---

#Databases are great at these types of questions
--

##It's what they were made for
--

##SQL will let us ask these questions

---

#SQL looks like:

```
SELECT *
FROM injuries
```
--

#In english: "select all the injuries"

---

#SQL looks like:

```
SELECT *
FROM injuries
WHERE BOROUGH = 'QUEENS'

#Spatial joins in SQL

--

+ You can do the same spatial joins you would do in QGIS using SQL
--

+ They give you more control than QGIS does
--

+ And you don't have to create new shapefiles

---

#Spatial joins in SQL

--

## Let's start with a points in polygon join:

--

```
SELECT nyc_boro.*, COUNT(injuries)
FROM training.nyc_boro
JOIN training.injuries ON ST_Within(injuries.geom, nyc_boro.geom)
GROUP BY nyc_boro.gid
```

---

#Line by line:

```
SELECT nyc_boro.*, COUNT(injuries)
```

##"Select all of the nyc_boro columns and the count of injuries"

---

#Line by line:

```
FROM training.nyc_boro
```

##"Use the nyc_boro table"

---

#Line by line:

```
JOIN training.injuries ON ST_Within(injuries.geom, nyc_boro.geom)
```

##"Join with injuries, associate injuries with the borough they are within"

---

#Line by line:

```
GROUP BY nyc_boro.gid
```

##"Count by borough"

---

#In general we can write a points in polygon join like this:

```
SELECT polygons.*, COUNT(points)
FROM polygons
JOIN points ON ST_Within(points.geom, polygons.geom)
GROUP BY polygons.unique_id
```

--

## Just replace *points* and *polygons* with the table names

---

---

![img-center-90](images/db-manager-join-results.png)

---

![img-center-90](images/spatial-join-attribute-table.png)

---

#Your turn
+ Use DB Manager and SQL to do a points in polygon join to count injuries in community disctricts (table *nyc_cd*)
+ Add the results as a layer in QGIS
+ Style the community districts by the number of injuries
