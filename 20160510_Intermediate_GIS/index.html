#How do we make maps?

---

#Geographic Information System (GIS)
> Any system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface

+ [National Geographic Education Encyclopedia](http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/)

---

#Or more simply

> In a GIS, you connect _**data**_ with _**geography**_.

+ [GISgeography.com](http://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/)

---

#Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
--

+ Create interactive queries (user-created searches)
--

+ Analyze spatial information
--

+ Edit data in maps
--

+ Present the results of all these operations

---

class:center,middle
#Let's Get Started

![img-center-20](images/qgis_launch.png)

---

#A quick note on exercises
--

+ We're going to be working with real-world data
--

+ Real-world data has issues
--

+ We're going to be showing you how to deal with these issues
--

+ The learning in this class happens when you do the steps along with us
--

+ Try and help each other out as we go
--

+ We'll make sure not to leave anyone behind
--

+ If these data problems aren't your data problems, hopefully the techniques will be useful in the work you do

#Let's make a map
![img-center-80](images/p1_finished.png)
---

#Base Maps 
--

+ Adding base maps will give your map context
--

+ In QGIS, you need a plugin to use base maps
--

+ There are several, but we're only going to use one of them

---

#Base Map Plugin
+ From the Plugins menu, select "Manage and Install Plugins"

![img-center-60](images/basemap2.png)

---

#Base Map Plugin

+ Search for the QuickMapServices plugin and install it

![img-center-75](images/basemap3_box.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Go to the Settings Menu
![img-center-80](images/basemap4.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Get the contributed packs
![img-center-80](images/basemap5_box.png)

---

#Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
![img-right-45](images/basemap6_trim.png)
+ Revel in all the beautiful base maps

---

#Select a base map from the list

---

#Adding Layers
![img-full](images/map1.png)
####Image Source: http://www.geocontrolling.com/co-je-gis.htm

---

#Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

---

#Download a shapefile and import
1. [Click this link](data/boros/boros.zip) and download the file to your desktop
2. Unzip the file

#What is a Coordinate Reference System?

---

# Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

--

[Digital Coast Geozone](https://geozoneblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/happy-birthday-mercator/)

---

#Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

![img-center-50](images/projections-faces.png)

[FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2014/01/13/map-projections-illustrated-with-a-face/)

---

#Projections

+ For the most part we will work in **WGS 84** (latitude and longitude)
--

+ In NYC, we use a more accurate projection **NY State Plane/Long Island Zone**
![img-right-60](images/projections_NYSplane.png)

######Source: https://alidade.wikispaces.com/New+York+SPCS+Zones
---

# Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs that make it easier to talk about them
--

+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**
--

+ State Plane Long Island is referred to as **EPSG:2263**
--

#Who's used one before?

---

#What is a database?

--

> An organized collection of data.

##[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)
---

#What is a database?

> A set of data that has a regular structure and that is organized in such a way that a computer can easily find the desired information.

![img-center-90](images/databases.jpg)
#####Source: http://blog.hackerrank.com/new-domain-tuesday-hackerrank-reveals-data-structure-database-sql-challenges/

---

#What is a database?
+ Another source of data
--

+ A program that often runs on a computer other than the one you're using (a server)
--

+ You can connect to databases through many types of software, including QGIS

---

#What is a spatial database?
--

+ A database that stores spatial features
--

+ Optimized for processing spatial data, especially location-aware queries
--

+ Both a storage and analysis tool

#Exercise 1 - Selecting Injuries in a Borough
1. Add the `injuries` table to your map
2. Right click and select "Filter..."
![img-right-40](images/filter_pg_layer1.png)

![img-right-55](images/save_filter2.png)

---

#Let's talk datatypes

--

![img-center-80](images/qgis_nav7.png)

--

+ In the attribute table you will usually see *text*, *numbers*, and *dates*

---

#Let's talk datatypes

![img-center-80](images/qgis_attribute_table_number.png)

--

##Numbers will be right aligned

---

#Let's talk datatypes

![img-center-80](images/qgis_attribute_table_string.png)

--

##Text will be left aligned

---

#Database datatypes

--

+ Like attribute tables, database columns have types
--

+ Numbers, text (*strings*), and dates are the main types
--

+ Spatial databases add *geometry* columns
--

+ Geometry columns let us map our data

---

#Why use a spatial database?

--

+ One authoritative copy of data
--

+ Multiple people can use and edit it at once
--

+ Generally is going to be faster than using a shapefile

---

#Drawbacks of using a spatial database

--

+ Not as simple as a CSV file or shapefile
--

+ It takes some setup to connect to a database
--

+ Need permission to connect to a database
--

+ Need to know SQL to get the most out of it

#Thematic Maps

--

+ Focuses on a specific theme or subject area
--

+ Features on the map represent the phenomenon being mapped
--

+ Spatial features used for reference

---

#General Reference Maps

--

+ Show important physical features of an area
--

+ Include natural and man-made features
--

+ Usually meant to help aid in the navigation or discovery of locations
--

+ Usually fairly simple
--

+ Can be stylized based on the intended audience (tourists vs locals)

#Now let's ask something a little more complicated

---

#Exercise 3 - Bicyclist Injuries
+ Which community board has the highest number of bicyclist injuries off of bicycle paths?

![img-right-45](images/buffer0.png)
--

#How do we answer this?
<!-- ![img-center-40](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png) -->

---

#Steps to answer
--

1. Buffer bicyclist injuries (points)
--

2. Select injuries near bike lanes (intersection of buffers with bike lane) 
--

3. Invert the selection to find injuries that happened off of bike lanes
--

4. Count the number of injuries off of bike lanes by community boards
--

5. Style the result

---

#What we're going to create
![img-center-90](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png)

---

#Step 1: Buffer bicyclist injuries

![img-center-70](images/buffer1.png)

---

#Step 1: Buffer bicyclist injuries
+ Create a 15ft around injury locations

![img-center-60](images/buffer2.png)

---

#Buffering features
--

+ Gives "size" to 2-D features
--

+ Points don't have area
--

+ Lines have length but don't have width
--

+ Allows for analysis of overlap and intersection

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-left-50](images/buffer3.png)
![img-right-48](images/buffer4_box.png)

---

#Oops
![img-center-70](images/buffer5.png)

---

#Map Units
--

+ Each projection has a base unit of distance
--

+ For WGS 84 it's decimal degrees<br>
--
_Know how big 15 decimal degrees are?_
--

+ Best to convert to a projection with simple map units
--

+ For NYC, EPSG:2263 is best (the map units are in feet)
---

#Pop Quiz
##Reproject the `injuries` layer to EPSG:2263
![img-right-50](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7306/8731759135_58989f9e56.jpg)
--

+ Right click the layer and select `Save As...`
--

+ Select the new projection
--

+ Give the file a descriptive name
--

+ Click `OK`

--

###Notice we're saving data from the database locally on our computer when we reproject

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-right-45](images/buffer6.png)
+ Make sure you select your reprojected layer
+ Set the distance to 15 (this time it'll be feet)
+ Set your output shapefile
+ Select `OK`

---

#Buffering features in QGIS
![img-center-70](images/buffer7.png)

---

#Step 2: Select injuries near bike lanes
![img-center-70](images/buffer8.png)

---

#Select by location in QGIS
+ There's a plugin for that

![img-left-55](images/spatialq1.png)
![img-right-43](images/spatialq2.png)

---

#Select by location in QGIS
![img-right-40](images/spatialq3.png)
+ Select the buffered injuries layer
+ Select `Intersects`
+ Select the bike routes layer
+ Select `Create new selection`
+ Click `Apply`

---

#Select by location in QGIS
![img-right-70](images/spatialq4_box2.png)
+ Click `Close`

---

#What did we just do?
--

1. Created a 15ft buffer around bicyclist injuries
--

2. Selected injuries that intersected a bike lane<br>
--

(Meaning it happened on or near a bike lane)
--


#Still to do
--

+ Find the injuries that happened off of bike lanes
--

+ Count injuries off bike lane by Community Board
--

+ Style the result

---

#Step 3: Find injuries off of bike lanes

#Step 3: Find injuries off of bike lanes
![img-right-50](images/invert4_box.png)
+ Create a layer of the selected features

---

#Step 4: Join result to Community Boards
![img-right-50](images/join_cd_injury.png)
+ Join the Community Boards to the bicyclist injuries off of bicycle lanes

---

#Step 5: Style the result
![img-center-90](images/nycd_bike_injuries_not_bike_route.png)

---

#By the way...
+ What percentage of bicyclist injuries happen on bike lanes?
--

+ What does that number suggest to you?
--


##Maybe stay in bike lanes?
![img-right-50](http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GIF-Bike-accident.gif)

---

#Your Turn
+ Filter the result for your borough
+ Style a map of just the community boards in your borough
+ Develop a hypothesis as to why the injuries are happening in those areas

---

#What we've covered
--

+ Reviewed basic mapping concepts
--

+ Reviewed projections
--

+ Added basemaps and layers (shapefile and CSV)
--

+ Styling features
--

+ Introduced spatial databases
--

+ Connected to a spatial database, filtered, and saved data as a shapefile
--

+ Discussed map types
--

+ Processed spatial data (joined, buffered, selected, reprojected, and saved)

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software
--

+ Proprietary software source code is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit)
--

+ Open source software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing

---

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software
+ Proprietary software code is generally supported by a team of paid professionals working for the organization that owns the code
--

+ Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals that contribute changes back to the community
---

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software
+ Proprietary software is often available only by purchasing a license
--

+ Open source software is free to use though there generally a license that specifies the restrictions (if any) on its use and reuse
--

+ Companies using open source software may charge for the use of the software through their proprietary implementations or via their infrastructure

#Some things about QGIS...

---

#QGIS - The Good
--

+ Open-source software that’s freely available
--

+ Works with lots of different data types, including shapefiles, KML (Google Earth), GeoJSON, and text files
--

+ Works with various spatial databases
--

+ Strong community developing features and plug-ins
---

#QGIS - The Bad
--

+ Not an enterprise software like ESRI ArcGIS
--

+ The visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features tend to change between versions (moving around, menu option changes, etc) 
--

+ Major versions tend to have major feature changes
--

+ Plug-ins tend not to work with newer versions
--

+ And it crashes (as you've probably already experienced)

---

#And of course...
![img-ful](images/bug.png)

---

#QGIS - The Bug-y
--

+ Projects with different CRS layers tend to get misaligned when zooming
--

+ _Zoom in and then back out to fix_
--

+ Plug-ins sometimes don't work like they're supposed to
--

+ _Save your project, close QGIS, re-open, and try again_
--

+ Other odd behavior that they’re hopefully working on
--

+ _File them here: https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Bugreports_

---

#SQL
--

+ Structured Query Language
--

+ The language databases understand
---

#SQL queries
--

+ Can *view* data
--

+ and *change* data
--

##We're going to stick to *viewing* data

---

![img-center-80](images/paper-stack.jpg)

---

#You might ask:

![img-right-30](images/paper-stack.jpg)

+ Which pages refer to properties in Brooklyn?
--

+ Which pages refer to properties in Brooklyn that have been built on since 1950?
--

+ What are the addresses of those properties?

---

#Databases are great at questions like these
--

+ It's what they were made for
--

+ SQL will let us ask these questions

---

#SQL looks like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM injuries
```
--

+ In english: "select all the injuries"

--

```sql
SELECT *
FROM injuries
WHERE BOROUGH = 'QUEENS'
```
--

+ In english: "select all the injuries in Queens"

---

#You can combine conditions

```sql
SELECT *
FROM injuries
WHERE borough = 'QUEENS' AND contributi = 'Fatigued/Drowsy'
```

--

```sql
SELECT *
FROM injuries
WHERE contributi = 'Outside Car Distraction' OR contributi = 'Fatigued/Drowsy'
```

#Spatial joins in SQL
--

+ You can do the same spatial joins you have done in QGIS using SQL
--

+ They give you more control than QGIS does
--

+ And you don't have to create new shapefiles

---

#Spatial joins in SQL
--

+ Let's start with a points in polygon join:

--

```sql
SELECT nyc_boro.*, COUNT(injuries)
FROM nyc_boro
JOIN injuries ON ST_Within(injuries.geom, nyc_boro.geom)
GROUP BY nyc_boro.gid
```

---

#Line by line:

```sql
SELECT nyc_boro.*, COUNT(injuries)
```

##"Select all of the `nyc_boro` columns and the count of `injuries`"

---

#Line by line:

```sql
FROM nyc_boro
```

##"Use the `nyc_boro` table"

---

#Line by line:

```sql
JOIN injuries ON ST_Within(injuries.geom, nyc_boro.geom)
```

##"Join with `injuries`, associate `injuries` with the `nyc_boro` they are within"

---

#Line by line:

```sql
GROUP BY nyc_boro.gid
```

##"Count by borough"

---

# All together:

```sql
SELECT nyc_boro.*, COUNT(injuries)
FROM nyc_boro
JOIN injuries ON ST_Within(injuries.geom, nyc_boro.geom)
GROUP BY nyc_boro.gid
```

--

#In general we can write a points in polygon join like this:

```sql
SELECT polygons.*, COUNT(points)
FROM polygons
JOIN points ON ST_Within(points.geom, polygons.geom)
GROUP BY polygons.unique_id
```

--

## Just replace *points* and *polygons* with the table names, *unique_id* with a unique id from your polygons table

---

#Your turn
+ Use DB Manager and SQL to do a points in polygon join to count injuries in community disctricts (table *nyc_cd*)
+ Add the results as a layer in QGIS
+ Style the community districts by the number of injuries

#Heatmaps

--

+ One way of mapping density when you have many points
--

+ An alternative to choropleth maps if you want to show a little more nuance

#Heatmaps in QGIS

--

+ Use the *Heatmap* plugin
--

+ Create a raster (image) showing the density of the points
--

+ Style the raster

# Your turn
+ Filter DOT 311 requests (`dot_311`) by borough and by type
+ Join filtered requests to community districts (`nyc_cd`)
+ Create a choropleth of the number complaints in each community district
+ Create a heatmap of complaints in your borough
+ You can do this in SQL or QGIS (your choice)
+ We'll be around to help
+ Hint: Be thinking about the problems we've run into with joining layers
